This tutotial describes the overall software architecture of ResearchPackage and its API, and how to get started.

## API and Architecture

### API Naming

We are following the pattern from Apple's Research Kit's when it comes to naming. ResearchKit uses the prefix `ORK` (Open Research Kit) before the names of classes, types etc. Following this naming model, the class names in ResearchPackage starts a `RP` prefix. UI widgets uses the `RPUI` (Research Package UI) prefix.

> Note that objects starting with `RP` are part of the Model (e.g. `RPConsentDocument`) while those which start with `RPUI` are part of the UI library (e.g. `RPUIVisualConsentStep`).

### Main Domain Model

Overall, ResearchPackage uses a `Task` to represent the survey containing a list of `Step`s, which each returns a `Result`.
In the API, the task is an [`RPOrderedTask`](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_model/RPOrderedTask-class.html) object and the steps are [`RPQuestionStep`](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_model/RPQuestionStep-class.html) objects.
Results are saved as [`RPTaskResult`](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_model/RPTaskResult-class.html) objects.

Below is an example of a hierarchy with a task, three steps, each with a specific answer type.

### BLoC Architecture

ResearchPackage follows the [BLoC architecture](https://medium.com/flutterpub/architecting-your-flutter-project-bd04e144a8f1),
which is recommended by the [Flutter Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE).
In ResearchPackage, the [BlocTask](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_model/BlocTask-class.html) is holding the StreamControllers needed for the communication.

Following the BLoC architecture, ResearchPackage uses streams and callbacks for internal communication (e.g. between Task and Steps).
There is a BLoC class responsible for the communication between the task and the steps it's containing ([BlocTask](https://pub.dev/documentation/research_package/latest/research_package_model/BlocTask-class.html)). Communication between the question container and their question body is made possible via callback functions.

## Style and UI Theme

Research Package is accessing the parent application's style through Flutter's `context` feature. This means that the given `Theme` of the application is shared also with Research Package and appears in its styling (colors, font styles...).
As an example, the [example application](https://github.com/cph-cachet/research.package/tree/master/example/research_package_demo_app) shows how the theme colors of the parent application are modified, and this is refelcted in the ResearchPackage screens.

See [this article by the Flutter team](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes) on how to Theme your application.

## How to set up a ResearchPackage project

Research Package is [published to `pub.dev`](https://pub.dev/packages/research_package) and all you have to do is to add its dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dart
  dependencies:
     research_package: ^{latest_version}
```

After you run the `flutter packages get` command, you are able to import and start using ResearchPackage.
You can import the whole package including the Model and UI libraries:

```dart
import 'package:research_package/research_package.dart';
```

Or you can decide which library of the package you want to use:

```dart
import 'package:research_package/model.dart';
import 'package:research_package/ui.dart';
```

## Limitations

Research Package currently supports only a few [answer formats](answer-formats) which can be put on separate pages or combined in one page (using a `FormStep`).
Nonetheless, we are constantly working on the package so these features, as well as more type of questions will be implemeted in the future.
